# F1Pitstop
Compare thes pit stop times of F1 drivers

The pit stop shows the real nature of F1 racing. Driver and the team have to work together in every aspect to accomplish a great result. Most of the work is done behind the scenes during the development of the car. But the most critical part of the race we can see on the TV is the pit stop. During a few seconds, drivers can lose, gain positions, or even a mistake like a poorly bolted wheel can cost a whole race. Therefore, I was always highly passionate about teamwork, coordination, and how quickly the pit crew can change four wheels and send the car back on the track.
